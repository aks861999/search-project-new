api/middleware.py — ASGI middleware for the Würth Search API.

Middleware applied (in order, outermost first):
    1. RequestTimingMiddleware  — adds X-Process-Time-Ms response header
                                   and logs method + path + status + latency
    2. CorrelationIdMiddleware  — generates/forwards X-Correlation-ID
                                   so distributed traces can be joined

Usage in api/main.py:
    from api.middleware import add_middleware
